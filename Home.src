== py2js ==

Welcome to py2js! The py2js library translates Python code into Javascript,
attempting as close to a one-to-one mapping as is possible. In order to keep the
generated Javascript highly readable and similar to the original Python code, it
depends on a small Javascript library which adds a number of pythonic touches to
Javascript.

=== Function Definitions ===

Python:
  def test(x):
      print x

Javascript:
  function test(x) {
      print(x);
  }
