This file contains some notes that might help you find your way around
in the source code for this project.

Folder 'library' contains a single file
'/strings/string_formatting.js'.  This file contains functions, with
name prefix 'py2js_', related I think to the formatting of strings.

Folder 'modules' contains subfolders 'javascript' and 'python'.

Folder 'modules/javascript' contains a single file
'MersenneTwister19937class.js'

Folder 'modules/python' contains an empty '__init__.py' and also
'mtrandom.py'.

The files in 'modules' contain implementations of a Mersenne Twister
random number generator.

Folder 'tests' contains tests.  I'll discuss that later.

The top level folder also contains some files.  Here are the source
code files:

jsbackend.py

jsmap.py

overview_tests.py

parsetree.py

py2js.py

py2js_test.py

pyfrontend.py

pylib.js: A library of javascript code to provide an equivalent to
python built-in functions and methods.
